# AppStore assets

This repository contains all the assets used for AppStores.

- [OpenTTD's Steam Store Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1536610/OpenTTD/).

## Folder structure

In `assets` are all the assets specific to a single store.
Most often, those have very specific (size) requirements and are as such custom-made for that store.

In `lang` are the translations of blobs of text used on the stores.
As most stores use the same blobs, those are as generic as possible, and do not mention the stores itself.
[eints](https://translator.openttd.org) takes care of the translations.

In `news` are the assets used for news posts on various of stores.

In `screenshots` is our collection of screenshots we publish on stores.
